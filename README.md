The WebApp that has been created using Flask in my project is a simple blog, where users can register, login, create and update blog posts. In the home page, there is a blog name on the upper left corner of the navigation bar and there are Login and Register links on the right corner. If an user tries to register with an already existing email in the database, an error will show up. Database has been created using SQLAlchemy. After a successful registration, a sign ‘Your account has been created! You are now able to log in’ will show up and user will be redirected to login page. Bootstrap component library has been used for design. After successful login, on the right hand side of the navigation bar now instead of Login and Register there will be New Post, Account and Logout links. By clicking New Post an user can create a new post by writing a title and a content and post it. A new post will show profile picture, username of the user and it will also show the date it was posted. On the Account page the user can see and update their username, profile picture, email information. When clicking on the username, we go to user’s page where we can see all the numbers and content of blog posts by that user. If an user forgets their password, he/she can click on the Forgot Password? link on the login page, and the user will be redirected to the reset_password page where he/she can enter their email address to get a one time token in order to renew their password.
